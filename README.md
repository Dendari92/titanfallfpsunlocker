Titanfall FPS Unlocker
======================

Unlock Titanfall FPS on PC.

The Basic Idea
==============

Trick the game so it detects a higher refresh rate monitor.

How To Do It
============

AMD Users:

  1.  Download Custom Resolution Utility (link: http://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU);
  2.  Add a new "Detailed resolution" with the desired refresh rate (e.g. 1920x1080 144Hz);
  3.  Apply changes and restart your PC (in case of issues launch Windows in Safe Mode or Low Res mode);
  4.  Download and install Multiress (link: http://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/multires.shtm);
  5.  Create a new batch file on the desktop and rename it to "TF144Hz.bat" (whatever name you want but remember the extension ".bat");
  6.  Copy this: http://pastebin.com/0Qgdp78F (change resolution and directories based on your own);
  7.  Launch the .bat file and wait about 10 seconds (you should see a black screen caused by improper refresh rate);
  8.  Now Titanfall is running at higher FPS than your monitor refresh rate.
